Scripts
=======
Miscellenious scripts of no particular value.
Nothing is generalized, all under "works-for-me"/ Public Domain license.
If something breaks, you get to keep both halfs! :)

* **fix-macosx.py** - fix various osX annoyances. Fixed it locally by not using OsX. Been a fun ride!
* **gc_git.sh** - garbage collect git repositories
* **flac2mp3** - converts multiple media formats to MP3/320kps
* **gc_git** - Garbage collect Git projects. Sometimes the overall size increases, so IMMV
* **imguralbum.py** - Downloads and entire imgurl album. No idea if it still works, been several years
* **mkv2mp4** - Convert MKV files to MP4 files, since that's what my TV supports and I'm too cheap to by another TV box
* **sign_all.sh** - sign all installed osX apps (I since stopped using OsX, why is it still here?)
* **stopwatch.py** - trivial stopwatch script
* **update_git.sh** - update all git repositores (that were mostly cloned from Github. Such is life)
* **update_python_packages.py** - updates all install Python3 packages, assuming you're using the same exact setup as me. 
* **view_bookmarks.py** - opens all URLS in a bookmarks file in new tabs. I use it to associate reference lists to projects.
